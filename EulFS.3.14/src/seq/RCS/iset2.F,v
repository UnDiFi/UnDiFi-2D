@      SUBROUTINE ISET2(IDX,NODCODE,NDIM,NOFVAR,NPOIN,ROWBGN)
C
C     This routine creates PETSc Index Sets addressing
C          boundary meshpoints with various types of
C          boundary conditions.
C     In the parallel case it is important that
C          the routine is called with NPOIN=# of processor
C          owned nodes, since the index sets are local
C          and shoud not address ghost nodes
