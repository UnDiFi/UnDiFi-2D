Routines for the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model
many routines were contributed by Renato Paciorri
University of Rome La Sapienza

Renato's model is classified as (SA-noft2)
according to
http://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/spalart.html
since the ft2 function is omitted

starting in 2008, the standard version has been
replaced by that suggested in G.A.Ashford's thesis,
which is classified as (SA-fv3) in
http://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/spalart.html
according to the website curator:
"This form of the Spalart-Allmaras model came about as a result of e-mail exchanges 
between the model developer and early implementers. 
It was devised to prevent negative values of the source term, 
and is not recommended because of unusual transition behavior at low Reynolds 
numbers (see Spalart, P. R., AIAA 2000-2306, 2000). 
Unfortunately, coding of this version still persists."

in order to recover the original model (SA-noft2),
we should co the correct revision of:
tsc.f and tfv2.f


sa7    coupled approach, compressible flows,
       kinematic turbulent viscosity
sa7b   coupled approach, compressible flows,
       molecular turbulent viscosity
sa8    coupled approach, INcompressible flows,
       kinematic turbulent viscosity
