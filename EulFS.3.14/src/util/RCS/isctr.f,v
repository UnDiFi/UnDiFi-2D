C     ==================================================================
C     ==================================================================
C     ====  ISCTR -- INTEGER SCATTER                                   ====
C     ==================================================================
C     ==================================================================
C
C     PURPOSE
C     -------
C
C         ISCTR SCATTERS THE COMPONENTS OF 
C             A SPARSE VECTOR  X  STORED IN COMPRESSED FORM  (X,INDX) 
C         INTO 
C             SPECIFIED COMPONENTS OF A INTEGER VECTOR  Y  
C             IN FULL STORAGE FORM.
C
C         ONLY THE ELEMENTS OF  Y  WHOSE INDICES ARE LISTED IN  INDX 
C         ARE MODIFIED.  THE VALUES IN  INDX  MUST BE DISTINCT TO
C         ALLOW CONSISTENT VECTOR OR PARALLEL EXECUTION.
C
C         ALTHOUGH DISTINCT INDICES WILL ALLOW VECTOR OR PARALLEL
C         EXECUTION, MOST COMPILERS FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE MACHINES WILL
C         BE UNABLE TO GENERATE BEST POSSIBLE CODE WITHOUT SOME 
C         MODIFICATION, SUCH AS COMPILER DIRECTIVES, TO THIS CODE.
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C     ---------
C
C     INPUT ...
C
C         NZ      INTEGER     NUMBER OF ELEMENTS TO BE SCATTERED FROM 
C                             COMPRESSED FORM.
C         X       INTEGER        ARRAY CONTAINING THE VALUES TO BE 
C                             SCATTERED FROM COMPRESSED FORM INTO FULL 
C                             STORAGE FORM.
C         INDX    INTEGER     ARRAY CONTAINING THE INDICES OF THE VALUES
C                             TO BE SCATTERED FROM COMPRESSED FORM.  
C                             IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE ELEMENTS IN  INDX 
C                             ARE DISTINCT.
C
C     OUTPUT ...
C
C         Y       INTEGER        ARRAY WHOSE ELEMENTS SPECIFIED BY  INDX
C                             HAVE BEEN SET TO THE CORRESPONDING 
C                             ENTRIES OF  X.  ONLY THE ELEMENTS  
C                             CORRESPONDING TO THE INDICES IN  INDX
C                             HAVE BEEN MODIFIED.
