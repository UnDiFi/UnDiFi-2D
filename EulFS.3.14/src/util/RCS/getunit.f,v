C
C! GET_UNIT returns a free FORTRAN unit number.
C
C
C  Discussion:
C
C    A "free" FORTRAN unit number is an integer between 1 and 99 which
C    is not currently associated with an I/O device.  A free FORTRAN unit
C    number is needed in order to open a file with the OPEN command.

C  Parameters:
C
C    Output, integer IUNIT.
C
C    If IUNIT = 0, then no free FORTRAN unit could be found, although
C    all 99 units were checked (except for units 5 and 6).
C
C    Otherwise, IUNIT is an integer between 1 and 99, representing a
C    free FORTRAN unit.  Note that GET_UNIT assumes that units 5 and 6
C    are special, and will never return those values.
