@      DOUBLE PRECISION STAGFIX
      COMMON / fix / STAGFIX
C
C     ..STAGFIX is used to solve the problems encountered with
C       stagnation regions, its value is tipically = MACHSQR
C
C     ..The right eigenvector matrix R(*,*) is multiplyed with
C       STAGFIX while the advection speeds or eigenvalues are
C       divided by STAGFIX
