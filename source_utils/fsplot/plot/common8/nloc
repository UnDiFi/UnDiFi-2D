C	If you modify the NLOC common, you have to modify the
C	same common in the routines "ShowMemoryMap", "vide"
C       and "blockdata" where it is NOT included. 
C	Also, if you add a table, modify NTBL accordingly
C	in the common ALLOC (also in "blockdata")
C       and the array TABNAME in the routine
C	ShowMemoryMap.
